- [ ] Build command set to `npm run build`
- [ ] Publish directory set to `dist`
- [ ] Node version set to 18 or higher

### Step 4: Environment Variables

- [ ] Set value to your actual Gemini API key
- [ ] Verify key is correct and active

### Step 5: Advanced Settings (Optional)
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if needed)
- [ ] SSL certificate enabled (automatic)
- [ ] Headers configured for security
- [ ] Redirects set up (if needed)

### Step 6: Deploy
- [ ] Click "Create Static Site"
- [ ] Monitor build logs for errors
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete
- [ ] Test deployed application

## Post-Deployment Verification

### âœ… Functionality Testing
- [ ] Website loads correctly
- [ ] All pages/steps are accessible
- [ ] Image upload works
- [ ] AI analysis functions
- [ ] Product recommendations display
- [ ] Cart functionality works
- [ ] Chatbot responds correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified

### âœ… Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load speed is acceptable
- [ ] Images load properly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] API calls work correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works on all devices

### âœ… Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] API key is not exposed in client code
- [ ] No sensitive data in browser
- [ ] Security headers are set

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
- **Issue**: `npm install` fails
  - **Solution**: Check Node.js version, clear npm cache
- **Issue**: TypeScript errors during build
  - **Solution**: Fix type errors in code, check tsconfig.json
- **Issue**: Missing dependencies
  - **Solution**: Add missing packages to package.json

### Runtime Errors
- **Issue**: "API_KEY not found" error
  - **Solution**: Set GEMINI_API_KEY in Render environment variables
- **Issue**: Images not loading
  - **Solution**: Verify images are in public/ directory
- **Issue**: Routing issues
  - **Solution**: Ensure SPA routing is configured in render.yaml

### Performance Issues
- **Issue**: Slow loading
  - **Solution**: Optimize images, check CDN configuration
- **Issue**: API timeouts
  - **Solution**: Check Gemini API limits and quotas

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Updates
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs
- [ ] Update product catalog as needed

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error monitoring
- [ ] Monitor API usage
- [ ] Track user analytics
- [ ] Monitor build times
- [ ] Check for broken links

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Process
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your service
3. Go to "Deploys" tab
4. Click "Rollback" on previous working deployment

### Quick Fixes
- Environment variable changes take effect immediately
- Code changes require new deployment
- Static assets are cached (may need cache clear)
